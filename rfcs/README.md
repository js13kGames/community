# RFCs
[Intro]: #intro

The "RFC" (request for comments) process is intended to provide a consistent and controlled path for substantial 
changes to the competition (such as changes in rules) so that all stakeholders can participate in the direction
the competition is going.


## The process
[The process]: #the-process

In order to propose a substantial change to the competition:

  - Fork this repository;
  - Copy `0000-template.md` to `text/0000-my-feature.md` (where "my-feature" is descriptive). Don't assign an 
    RFC number yet; This is going to be the PR number and we'll rename the file accordingly if the RFC is accepted;
  - Fill in the RFC. Put care into the details: RFCs that do not present convincing motivation, demonstrate lack of 
    understanding of the design's impact, or are disingenuous about the drawbacks or alternatives tend to be poorly-received;
  - Submit a pull request. Be prepared to participate in a discussion with the community and revise your design in 
    response to feedback. Build consensus and integrate feedback.
  - You can make edits, big and small, to the RFC to clarify or change the design, but make changes as new commits 
    to the pull request, and leave a comment on the pull request explaining your changes.
    Specifically, do not squash or rebase commits after they are visible on the pull request.
  - At some point, given enough feedback, a core team member will propose a "motion for final
    comment period" (FCP), along with a *disposition* for the RFC (merge, close,
    or postpone), with a given deadline;

Note that full consensus is generally impossible to achieve, and it is at the core team's discretion to make the final 
call - even bypassing the process entirely.
