# Summary
[summary]: #summary

A brief (one paragraph) overview of the proposal.


# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?


# Explanation
[explanation]: #explanation

Explain the design/feature in sufficient detail that:

- Its interaction with other features is clear;
- It is reasonably clear how the feature would be implemented;
- Corner cases are dissected by example;


# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this?


# Rationale and alternatives
[rationale-and-alternatives]: #rationale-and-alternatives

- Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?
- What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not choosing them?
- What is the impact of not doing this?


# Prior art
[prior-art]: #prior-art

Discuss prior art, both the good and the bad, in relation to this proposal. A few examples of what this can include are:

- Is this done by some other community and what were their experiences with it?
- What lessons can we learn from what other communities have done here?


# Unresolved questions
[unresolved-questions]: #unresolved-questions

- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the RFC process before this gets merged?
- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the implementation?
- What related issues do you consider out of scope for this RFC that could be addressed in the future independently 
  of the solution that comes out of this RFC?


# Future possibilities
[future-possibilities]: #future-possibilities

Think about what the natural extension and evolution of your proposal would be and how it would affect the project 
as a whole. This is also a good place to "dump ideas", if they are out of scope for the RFC but otherwise related.
